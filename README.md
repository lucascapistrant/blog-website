# blog-website

This repository serves as a showcase of my development process for my personal blogging website. The website was created without utilizing any external libraries.

At its current configuration, articles are integrated into the website by creating individual HTML files for each article and linking them within the main index.html file. While functional, this approach lacks efficiency and scalability. Please note that this method is a temporary solution and not optimal for a larger-scale website.

Moving forward, I would like to add a backend server to manage and add articles dynamically. This future upgrade aims to streamline the process of adding content, enabling a more organized and scalable structure for the blogging platform. As of now, the implementation of a backend server is beyond my current skill level.

This repository primarily serves as a historical record of the iterative development stages of my blogging website. It also acts as a portfolio piece.

Your interest in exploring this repository is appreciated, and I hope this documentation provides insight into my approach to web development at this point in time.
